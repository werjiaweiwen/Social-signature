Datasets are provided in the paper, and the specific process of our work is as follows

We first build social signatures, which are detailed in data processing.ipynb

Then verify the existence of Social signature. The specific process is in Social signature distance.ipynb, and Manwhitney test is in Manwhitney test.ipynb

Finally, users are identified by using social signatures. All user identification scenarios and the corresponding temporal stability and feature importance are included in User identification.ipynb
